I hope you enjoy while it lasts, because its gonna geet patched.
Fivem havent figured out this method yet, so i just posted it so everyone can have fun.
The AutoExecute.exe is a lua executer, that executes the script silently (which other executers cant)
That means that its 100% undetected, and can only be executed using the inbuild executor
